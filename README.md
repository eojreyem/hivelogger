# hivelogger
A mobile app for managing honeybee colonies in multiple apiaries and assessing queen performance.
A sticky-finger friendly UI. 

# Phase 1
Create a CRUD app using Ionic and Vue with objects: apiaries, colonies, visits, queens
Question: my old app assumed one user which greatly simplified things. I'd like to move forward assuming each user will have their own db. Multiple users modifying the same database adds a lot of complexity and could be a paid feature in the future.

Assume locally stored db with ability to for Cloud backup.
